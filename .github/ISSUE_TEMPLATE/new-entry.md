# Procedure

Please describe the journey someone would take through your organisation.  How would they contact you?  What steps would they go through?  What outcome(s) should they expect?

You might like to describe your procedure by reusing existing text from [the specialists page](sleepdiary.github.io/docs/specialists/), or you might prefer to write a long description of your organisation's procedure, which we will later cut down to size.

However you approach this section, it will probably take us several attempts to draft a good procedure.  Don't worry too much about getting it right first time!

# Locations

How many locations does the organisation operate at?

Please specify the following for each location...

Name of the location: 

Website for the location (if it has one):

Address for the location:

GPS co-ordinates for the location (but see below):

One easy way to get GPS co-ordinates for a location is to paste the address into [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/), right-click on the location, then click on the top-most entry in the menu that appears.  This will copy the GPS co-ordinates to your clipboard.

# Forms and reports

__WARNING:__ only upload files after receiving informed consent from the organisation, and don't upload reports containing personal information.  If your situation is within the spirit but not the letter of that rule, please discuss the situation with us before uploading.  Files uploaded in error are far more problematic than files uploaded in a follow-up message.

Please delete as appropriate:

* I own the copyright for all of these forms and reports, and I hereby give permission for them to be used
* I have received permission to make these forms available, which they will confirm when contacted
