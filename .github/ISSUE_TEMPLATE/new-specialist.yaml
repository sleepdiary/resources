        ## Procedure

        Please describe the journey someone would take through your organisation.  How would they contact you?  What steps would they go through?  What outcome(s) should they expect?

        You might like to describe your procedure by reusing existing text from [the specialists page](https://sleepdiary.github.io/docs/specialists/), or you might prefer to write a long description of your organisation's procedure, which we will later cut down to size.

        However you approach this section, it will probably take us several attempts to draft a good procedure.  Don't worry too much about getting it right first time!

        This is usually something like:
        1. how to book an appointment
        2. anything you need to do before your appointment
        3. how to attend an appointment
        4. anything you need to do between appointments
        5. intended outcome

        Here are some examples - copy/paste this text if possible:

        1. [register as a patient](https://www.example.com/register)
        1. [make an appointment](https://www.example.com/appointment)
        1. a physician will refer you if they feel it is necessary
        1. a physician will refer you if they feel it is necessary.  If no physician referral is available, [make an appointment directly](http://www.example.com/appointment)

        3. appointments can be at one of the specified locations, by phone, or by video chat

        5. your doctor will aim to diagnose your condition, may be able to offer treatment for a common condition (such as [DSPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_disorder)), or may refer you to someone who specialises in a rare condition (such as [non-24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-24-hour_sleep%E2%80%93wake_disorder))

        ## Forms and reports

        Please provide links to forms and reports hosted on the organisation's website, or attach files for us to host.

        It's recommended to host files on the organisation's site, so the organisation can update or deleting files at their convenience.  But we prefer hosted reports to use our [computer-generated datasets](/sleepdiary/resources/blob/main/common_sleep_diaries/), because it makes it easier to compare layouts.  These datasets are provided under [a &ldquo;no rights reserved&rdquo; license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/), so you're welcome to upload reports to your own site before contacting us.

        We're also happy to host files ourselves.  But _the organisation must give informed consent before you upload_, all _forms must be blank_, and all _reports must use our [computer-generated datasets](/sleepdiary/resources/blob/main/common_sleep_diaries/)_.  Uploads that don't meet these criteria are likely to be deleted.

        If your situation falls within the letter but not the spirit of the above, please discuss the situation with us before showing us anything contentious.  You can always reply with more details later, and it gives us time to think it through without needing to make a snap decision.
